// Enhance the Product class to support sales management based on product categories.
// Introduce a static attribute called categoryOnSale to track the current sale category.
// When creating a product, check if its category matches the sale category and adjust its sale status accordingly.
// Additionally, when updating a product's category, verify if it should now be on sale or no longer eligible for
// a discount based on the current sale category. Hint: create a method that will update the product category.
// If the sale category changes, ensure all existing products are updated to reflect the new sale status
// those in the sale category should receive a discount, while those no longer in the sale category should return
// to their regular price.
